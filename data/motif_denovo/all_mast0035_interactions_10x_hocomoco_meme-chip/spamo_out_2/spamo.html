   For the equations below the following variable name prefixes are used: 
     qp0 is the quadratic curve starting point (you must keep this from your 
        last point sent to moveTo(), lineTo(), or bezierCurveTo() ). 
     qp1 is the quadratic curve control point (this is the cpx,cpy you would 
        have sent to quadraticCurveTo() ). 
     qp2 is the quadratic curve ending point (this is the x,y arguments you 
        would have sent to quadraticCurveTo() ). 
   We will convert these points to compute the two needed cubic control points 
    (the starting/ending points are the same for both 
   the quadratic and cubic curves. 
 
   The exact equations for the two cubic control points are: 
     cp0 = qp0 and cp3 = qp2 
     cp1 = qp0 + (qp1 - qp0) * ratio 
     cp2 = cp1 + (qp2 - qp0) * (1 - ratio) 
     where ratio = (sqrt(2) - 1) * 4 / 3 exactly (approx. 0.5522847498307933984022516322796) 
                   if the quadratic is an approximation of an elliptic arc, 
                      and the cubic must approximate the same arc, or 
           ratio = 2.0 / 3.0 for keeping the same quadratic curve. 
 
   In the code below, we must compute both the x and y terms for each point separately. 
 
    cp1x = qp0x + (qp1x - qp0x) * ratio; 
    cp1y = qp0y + (qp1y - qp0y) * ratio; 
    cp2x = cp1x + (qp2x - qp0x) * (1 - ratio); 
    cp2y = cp1y + (qp2y - qp0y) * (1 - ratio); 
 
   We will now  
     a) replace the qp0x and qp0y variables with currentX and currentY 
        (which *you* must store for each moveTo/lineTo/bezierCurveTo) 
     b) replace the qp1x and qp1y variables with cpx and cpy (which we would 
        have passed to quadraticCurveTo) 
     c) replace the qp2x and qp2y variables with x and y. 
   which leaves us with:

// Rasterize Alphabet
// 1) Measure width of text at default font for all symbols in alphabet
// 2) sort in width ascending
// 3) Drop the top and bottom 10% (designed to ignore outliers like 'W' and 'I')
// 4) Calculate the average as the maximum scaling factor (designed to stop I becoming a rectangular blob).
// 5) Assume scale of zero would result in width of zero, interpolate scale required to make perfect width font
// 6) Draw text onto temp canvas at calculated scale
// 7) Find bounds of drawn text
// 8) Paint on to another canvas at the desired height (but only scaling width to fit if larger).

      <p>This logo is useful for detecting cases where highly
        similar regions (such as DNA repeats) are present

        Such cases may indicate that the spacing is due
        to recent duplication events rather than to
        a functional biological relationship between
        the primary and secondary motifs.  Ideally, the

      <dd>is the combination of quadrants used. Possible values are:
      individual quadrants (up+, up-, dn+, dn-) which are important

      (up+/dn-, up-/dn+) which are important when only the primary motif is
